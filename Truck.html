 <p class = "p">During 1965 the Department for Traffic of Federal Secretariat of People's Defense has formed work group with task to analyzes the unarmored vehicles of Yugoslav People's Army. The result of the work group was the study of non-combat vehicles and trailers in use with Yugoslav People's Army. The inferences of study were adopted by the Main Military Technical Council in 1966. The study has concluded that there are 129 different vehicle marks in 320 types in service. A decision was made to reduce number of different vehicle marks in service by development of five vehicle classes: 0,75 tons 4x4 off-road vehicle, 1,5 tons 4x4 off-road truck, 3 tons 6x6 off-road truck, 6 tons 6x6 off-road truck and 9 tons 8x8 heavy off-road truck.

    During the 1970s the plan for 1.5 t (1.5 long tons; 1.7 short tons) 4x4 and 3 t (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons) 6x6 off-road trucks was realized by TAM, while the 6x6 heavy truck was developed by the FAP. The first 6 t (5.9 long tons; 6.6 short tons) 6x6 military truck model developed by FAP was FAP 2220, mainly produced for transportation of the sections of PM M71 pontoon bridge and prototype series of M-77 Oganj self-propelled multiple rocket launcher. The new model, designated FAP 2026 BS/AV was developed during the late 1970s and introduced to service in 1978. It was based on the Mercedes-Benz NG with a OM 402 8-cylinder, 4-stroke, water cooled diesel engine, due to the fact that FAP has produced trucks under Mercedes-Benz licence.
    
    The FAP 2026 was mass-produced for the needs of the Yugoslav People's Army from 1978 until the 1994. Several small series were produced during the 1990s after the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Try to click the image</p>
